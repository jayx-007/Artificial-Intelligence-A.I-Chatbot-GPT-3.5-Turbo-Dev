# Artificial-Intelligence-A.I-Chatbot-GPT-3.5-Turbo-Dev
It has being a while I created and implemented an A.I system, so I had to refresh my ML skill by developing a Chatbot using OpenAI ML Model. I hope you find this mini side project resourceful for your practice.
This project is a Javascript(JS) based project, i made it so beacuse it would be easy for anyone with an average programming knowledge of JS to be able to understand the source code and how i went about the 
the implementation process using just JS, HTML and CSS(for the GUI front-end).

**Inorder to test this Project after you have downloaded it from this Repo follow the following steps stated below:**


1).You will have to visit the URL API Endpoint for OpenAI which is: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys , 
  { NOTE: If you do not have an account you will have to create one so that you can generate a free OpenAI API Key inorder for you to have access to the ML Model via the API Endpoint}
  
2). After you have created(generated) the OpenAI API_Key, then you will copy the key and replace it in the script.js file in the section where you find the variable decleration:
  const API_KEY = "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"; // Paste your API key here

  { NOTE: ” Remember that when you sign up for OpenAI, you’ll get a free $5.00 credit for your API usage.
          If your account is older than 3 months or the credit runs out, you’ll need a paid account or create a new one with a new number to keep using the API. 
          Your API usage and expiration date can be found on the account’s usage page.” }

3).When you are done with the above save the file and Open the Index.html file on a browser,after this it will load the Chatbot Prompt UI and then you can test the Chatbot by typing questions that
    are text-based and hit enter or the send button and after the ML model finds the best result and answer of your questions,then the prompt displays your result as required.

                                                              **THANK YOU**
